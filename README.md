# tic-tac-toe

I want to design a tic tac toe game from scratch. 

This is my initial thoughts on what i need to accomplish the task.

I need player 1 and player 2. 

I need variables that contain the cuurent user input data and location. 

a function that, after every turn that checks to see if the conditions for winning are metm, and, if not, coninues to the next 
player's turn. If a win, add CSS class that declares winner'

a function that checks if all available moves are made, and no winner, changes heading to say It's a tie.

Bonus:

If I can develop a function to determine if there is any path to victory remaing, and, if not, end the game in a draw. even before all possible moves are made
